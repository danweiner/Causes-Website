			<div class="col-1">
				<h2>On Women: </h2>
					<p> “You know, it really doesn’t matter what the media write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.”</p>  

				<p class="spoiler">
					<span>YES!</span>
				</p> 
		
					<br>
				<p>And this...</p>
	
					<br>
					<p>“All the women on The Apprentice flirted with me — consciously or unconsciously. That’s to be expected.”</p>
				<p class="spoiler">
					<span>YES!</span>
				</p>

			<div class="col-2">
				<h2>On Climate Change: </h2><p>“The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”</p>
				<p class="spoiler">
					<span>YES!</span>
				</p> 
			</div><!-- col -->
			<div class="col-3">
				<h2>On Immigration:</h2><p> "When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending the best. They're not sending you, they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. ... And some, I assume, are good people."</p>
				<p class="spoiler">
					<span>YES!</span>

				<h2>On Race Relations: </h2><p>"Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!"</p>
				<p class="spoiler">
					<span>YES!</span>
				</p> 
				<br>  
				<p>Also this...</p>
		
				<br>

				<p class="spoiler">
					<span>YES!</span>
				</p> 
			</div><!-- col -->
			<div class="col-6">
				<h2>On Gay Marriage: </h2><p>“It’s like in golf. A lot of people — I don’t want this to sound trivial — but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive. It’s weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can’t sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist.”</p>
