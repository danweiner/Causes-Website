		<h1>Donald Trump memorably announced <br>his race for the presidency Tuesday.</h1>

		<p>As part of the launch, he played Neil Young's "Rockin' in the Free World." The actual Neil Young was furious and immediately announced that Trump had no permission to use the song, noting that he's a Bernie Sanders supporter. David Crosby chimed in that "Neil will have him dismembered as soon as possible, which will be no loss at all."</p>

		<h3>Could there have been a Trumpier start to a presidential run?</h3>

		<p>Trump went on to kick off a season of goofball rhetoric with a braggadocious promise to help outgoing President Barack Obama find a good place to golf ("I have the best courses in the world"), a crude swipe at the entire Mexican-American demographic ("When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you") and a bizarre pledge to usher in a new, undead version of our national mission ("Sadly the American dream is deadâ€¦I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before").</p>
